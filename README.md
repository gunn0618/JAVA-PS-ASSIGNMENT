Problem Statement : A small grocery store wants to automate its basic billing process to save time and reduce manual calculation errors. The program should store a predefined list of items and their prices using arrays, accept the quantity of each item from the customer, and calculate the total bill. Using control statements, the system should skip displaying items with zero quantity and apply a discount if the total purchase exceeds a set amount. Looping structures should be implemented to handle multiple items efficiently, ensuring the solution reflects a real-world checkout experience.
